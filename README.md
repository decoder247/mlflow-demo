## How to run

Train
```bash
python src/train.py

#Or
make run
```

Train with parameters
```bash
python src/train.py <alpha> <l1_ratio>
```

Activate mlflow ui
```bash
mlflow ui
```
=======
## How it works

Run the example by running the command `make run`.

Each time you run the example, MLflow logs information about your experiment runs in the directory `mlruns`.

Enter the mlflow ui: `mlflow ui`. View at `<http://localhost:5000>`.
